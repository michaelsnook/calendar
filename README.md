# Calendar

This is a simple calendar with the full year on a single page. Designed to be printed, it will automatically adjust to any paper size or direction (though it looks best in landscape orientation).

* By default, the current year is used. You can override the year by supplying a `year` parameter, e.g. `/calendar.php?year=2027`.
* You can switch to a weekday-aligned rendering by setting the `layout` parameter value to `aligned-weekdays`.
* You can print the year on two pages by setting the parameter `half=1` or `half=2`.
